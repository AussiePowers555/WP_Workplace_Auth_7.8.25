# Main Workspace Implementation - COMPLETED

## ✅ Overview

The Main Workspace has been successfully created and configured for both developer accounts. This special workspace shows **ALL cases** across all workspaces and unassigned cases, providing a comprehensive view for admin users.

## 🏢 What Was Created

### 1. Main Contact
- **Name**: Main
- **Type**: Service Center  
- **Company**: Main Administration
- **Email**: admin@main.system
- **ID**: contact-1753810437008

### 2. Main Workspace
- **Name**: Main Workspace
- **Contact ID**: contact-1753810437008
- **Workspace ID**: workspace-1753810437159

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Features
1. **Special Filtering Logic**: Main Workspace bypasses workspace filtering and shows ALL cases
2. **Prominent Display**: Featured section at top of workspaces page
3. **Header Integration**: Displays "Main Workspace" in the top navigation
4. **Case Creation**: Cases created from Main Workspace are not assigned to any workspace

### Files Modified

#### 1. Cases Page (`src/app/(app)/cases/page.tsx`)
```typescript
// Updated filtering logic
if (activeWorkspace.name === 'Main Workspace') {
  visibilityPassed = true; // Shows ALL cases
} else {
  visibilityPassed = c.workspaceId === activeWorkspace.id;
}

// Updated case creation
workspaceId: activeWorkspace?.name === 'Main Workspace' ? undefined : activeWorkspace?.id,

// Updated description
{activeWorkspace.name === 'Main Workspace' 
  ? 'Showing all cases across all workspaces and unassigned cases'
  : `Showing cases filtered by ${activeWorkspace.type}: ${activeWorkspace.name}`
}
```

#### 2. User Header (`src/components/user-header.tsx`)
```typescript
// Updated display logic
{activeWorkspace ? (
  activeWorkspace.name === 'Main Workspace' ? (
    <span>Main Workspace</span>
  ) : (
    <>
      <span className="text-muted-foreground text-sm font-normal">{activeWorkspace.type}:</span>
      <span className="ml-1">{activeWorkspace.name} Workspace</span>
    </>
  )
) : (
  currentUser?.role === "admin" ? "Main Workspace" : "Dashboard"
)}

// Hide "Back to Main" button when already in Main Workspace
{activeWorkspace && currentUser?.role === "admin" && activeWorkspace.name !== 'Main Workspace' && (
  <Button onClick={clearWorkspace}>Back to Main</Button>
)}
```

#### 3. Workspaces Page (`src/app/(app)/workspaces/page.tsx`)
```typescript
// Added special Main Workspace section
{workspaces.find(ws => ws.name === 'Main Workspace') && (
  <div className="mb-6 p-4 border rounded-lg bg-primary/5">
    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Main Workspace</h3>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-3">View all cases across all workspaces and unassigned cases</p>
    <Card 
      className="cursor-pointer transition-all hover:shadow-lg border-primary/20 hover:border-primary/50"
      onClick={() => handleSelectWorkspace(workspaces.find(ws => ws.name === 'Main Workspace')!.id)}
    >
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle className="flex items-center gap-2 text-primary">
          <Building /> Main Workspace
        </CardTitle>
        <CardDescription>Shows all cases without filtering</CardDescription>
      </CardHeader>
    </Card>
  </div>
)}
```

## 🎯 User Experience

### For Admin Users (michaelalanwilson@gmail.com & whitepointer2016@gmail.com)

1. **Default State**: When no workspace is selected, shows "Main Workspace" in header
2. **Workspace Selection**: Can go to `/workspaces` and see Main Workspace prominently featured
3. **Main Workspace Active**: 
   - Header shows "Main Workspace"
   - Cases page shows "Workspace: Main Workspace"
   - Description: "Showing all cases across all workspaces and unassigned cases"  
   - No "Back to Main" button (already in main)
4. **All Cases Visible**: Sees every case in the system regardless of workspace assignment
5. **Case Creation**: New cases created from Main Workspace are unassigned to any workspace
